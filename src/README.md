# Tracecycle: Automated Quality & Compliance Layer

Tracecycle is an **invisible automation layer** designed for the circular polymer industry. We eliminate the administrative burden of manual traceability and accelerate the market entry of recycled materials.

## The Core Problem
High-quality mechanical and chemical recycling is currently bottlenecked by a "Trust & Technical Gap." Batch release processes are slow, manual, and rely on Excel-based estimates, making regulatory compliance (EU PPWR) a significant operational risk.

## Our Solution
Instead of a passive reporting platform, Tracecycle operates as a background engine that connects directly to production infrastructure.

### Key Capabilities:
* **Direct Sensor Correlation:** Passive integration with SCADA and PLC networks to capture real-time 1Hz production data.
* **Automated Batch Release:** Generation of Digital Material Cards and technical specifications the moment production ends.
* **Verified Traceability:** Audit-ready mass balance and Chain of Custody (CoC) reports derived from actual energy and mass flows, not manual input.
* **Yield Optimization:** Predictive analytics correlating feedstock source data with output quality and process efficiency.

## Technical Architecture
Built for industrial resilience and zero-touch compliance:
* **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
* **Data Strategy:** Passive Node integration (MQTT / OPC UA ready)
* **Analytics:** Real-time correlation between process parameters (torque, pressure, temperature) and material rheology.

## Why Tracecycle Wins
Unlike traditional traceability platforms, Tracecycle:
1.  **Requires Zero Manual Entry:** Automates data collection from source sensors.
2.  **Reduces Lead Times:** Shortens the technical approval cycle from months to minutes.
3.  **Ensures Compliance:** Provides tamper-proof data for PPWR and other global regulations.
