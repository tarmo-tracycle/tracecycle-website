# Tracecycle: Industrial Yield & Compliance Automation

Tracecycle is the **invisible layer** between production line sensors and customer compliance requirements. We automate the technical validation of recycled polymers.

## Key Capabilities
* **Sensor Correlation:** Passive integration with SCADA/PLC networks for real-time 1Hz data.
* **Batch Release Automation:** Shortening the technical approval cycle from days to minutes.
* **Verified Traceability:** Tamper-proof mass balance reports for EU PPWR compliance.
* **Yield Mapping:** Correlating feedstock quality with energy efficiency and output yield.

## Built for Industry
Tracecycle connects directly to industrial infrastructure (MQTT/OPC UA ready) to eliminate manual reporting and human error in the circular supply chain.
